Follow these instructions if you prefer the app to have real albums over generic ones:

1) Replace list from AlbumNamesList.swift with the following, or something like the following (the difference is the below has the albums' actual songs under the album "songList" parameters):

//Add cells here
let library = [

Album(title: "Yellow Submarine", songList: ["Yellow Submarine", "Only a Northern Song", "All Together Now","Hey Bulldog","All You Need Is Love"], artist: "The Beatles", genreTags: ["Rock"], id: "0", description: "Yellow Submarine is the tenth studio album by English rock band the Beatles.\nIt was released on 13 January 1969 in the United States and on 17 January in\nthe United Kingdom.", selftext_html: nil, coverImgName: "a1cover", subtitle: "The Beatles", category: "notused", score: 1000, num_comments: 50, stickied: false, created_utc: Date().timeIntervalSince1970 - 100, preview: nil, is_original_content: false, spoiler: false, replies: nil),

2) 	-Copy the cover images from this directory if necessary (a1cover.jpg, a2cover.png, etc) to the Assets.xcassets folder found in 	the open Xcode project (must be copied into the directory found inside the open Xcode project and NOT into that same directory 	from Finder). 
	-Or add your own to the folder (if you do this remember to change the album's declaration in library so it has the correct "	coverImgName" parameter)

3) 	-Add the song files (make sure their names match the exact names listed for your albums listed in library [see step 1]) to the 	directory "Music files" found in the open Xcode project(must be copied into the directory found inside the open Xcode project 	and NOT into that same directory from Finder).
	-Or simply rename the royalty-free mp3 files already there to: Yellow Submarine, Only a Northern Song, All Together Now, Hey 	Bulldog, and All You Need Is Love, etc

4) 	-Add missing data for other desired albums as necessary

Note: Each album declaration in list must have a different id (parameter "id") to show up as expected.
